# AOBD ore chunks
This is an addon for [AOBD](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1293528), it adds ore chunks that drop from smeltable ores.

This mod allows you to use fortune on smeltable ores so you can get more out of your fortune enchantment.

This mod does pretty much the exact same thing as [Fortune ores]() and it's also heavily inspired by it

This mod is heavily based on [AOBD berry bushes](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2472300).
